<div>
A week ago a friend invited a couple of other couples over for dinner. Eventually, 
the food (but not the wine) was cleared off the table for what turned out to be some 
fierce Scrabbling. Heeding the strategy of going for the shorter, more valuable word 
over the longer cheaper word, our final play was “Bon,” which–as luck would have it!–
happens to be a Japanese Buddhist festival, and not, as I had originally asserted while 
laying the tiles on the board, one half of a chocolate-covered cherry treat.
