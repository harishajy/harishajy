A week ago a friend invited a couple of other couples over for dinner. Eventually, 
the food (but not the wine) was cleared off the table for what turned out to be some 
fierce Scrabbling. Heeding the strategy of going for the shorter, more valuable word 
over the longer cheaper word, our final play was “Bon,” which–as luck would have it!–
happens to be a Japanese Buddhist festival, and not, as I had originally asserted while 
laying the tiles on the board, one half of a chocolate-covered cherry treat. Anyway, the
 strategy worked. My team only lost by 53 points instead of 58.Just the day before, our 
 host had written of the challenges of writing short. In journalism–my friend’s chosen t
 rade, and mostly my own, too–Mark Twain’s observation undoubtedly applies: “I didn’t have
  time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.” The principle holds across 
  genres, in letters, reporting, and other writing. It’s harder to be concise than to blather.
   (Full disclosure, this blog post will clock in at a blather-esque 803 words.) Good writing
    is boiled down, not baked full of air like a souffl??. No matter how yummy souffl??s may be.
     Which they are. Yummy like a Grisham novel.Lately, I’ve been noticing how my sentences have 
     a tendency to keep going when I write them onscreen. This goes for concentrated writing as 
     well as correspondence. (Twain probably believed that correspondence, in an ideal world, also 
     demands concentration. But he never used email.) Last week I caught myself packing four conjunctions
      into a three-line sentence in an email. That’s inexcusable. Since then, I have tried to eschew
       conjunctions whenever possible. Gone are the commas, the and’s, but’s, and so’s; in are staccato 
       declaratives. Better to read like bad Hemingway than bad Faulkner.Length–as we all know, and
        for lack of a more original or effective way of saying it–matters. But (ahem), it’s also a matter 
        of how you use it. Style and length are technically two different things.Try putting some prose
         onscreen, though, and they mix themselves up pretty quickly. This has much to do with the time 
         onstraints we claim to feel in the digital age. We don’t have time to compose letters and post 
         them anymore–much less pay postage, what with all the banks kinda-sorta losing our money these 
         days–so we blast a few emails. We don’t have time to talk, so we text. We don’t have time to 
         text to specific people, so we update our Facebook status. We don’t have time to write essays,
